# Music Genre Classification

This project is an attempt to replicate the research paper for Music Genre Classification by Nithil Mariya Stephen

Music genre classification is the task of automatically identifying the genre of a given audio
signal. It has many applications in the music industry, including recommendation systems,
personalized playlists, and content-based music retrieval. Traditional methods for music genre
classification include feature extraction and classification using algorithms k-nearest
neighbor, decision trees, and support vector machines are a few examples.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown significant improvement in the field of
music genre classification due to their ability to automatically extract features from raw audio
signals

The dataset used for this project was ```GTZAN``` dataset easily available at Kaggle
